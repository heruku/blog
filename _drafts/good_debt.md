title: "Good debt"
---

I've been thinking about debt lately. I've manged to navigate life so far without incurring
any financial debt. I'm scared of even considering a loan from a bank. It feels like it would
put me in a position of weakness. Like I don't own what I have. Like I can't enjoy what I have
because it's not bought with my own money. It feels dirty

What I've realised lately is that this is a completely emotional, irrational, and unproductive view of financial debt.
Of course you can cripple yourself financially by mismanaging debt.
On the flip side you can use debt to get further than you ever could have gone without it.
Ask people who have made good money in their life and many of them will tell you that
debt was an instrumental part in that. They won't yell it from the rooftop, but it was something
that got them to where they are. Another thing they'll tell you is that there is good debt and there is bad debt.
In the end, it's about doing the math and considering the risks. There are always risks associated with debt.

Rather than expose my complete ignorance on the topic of finance, let's look at how debt affects
our software teams. We refer to bad code as techincal debt. Some teams set up automated software to
track techincal debt. Some take a week at the end of the year to pay some of that debt. I feel the same
way about techinal debt as I do about financial debt: Yuck! I never want to write code that we need to come
back to and fix. I feel like techincal debt should be avoided at all costs.

Like with financial debt, this is a completely emotional, irrational, and unproductive view of techincal debt.
To use debt, we must look at the interest rate and the return on investment. The gap between the two should inform
how much risk we're willing to take. In software development, like in business, there are opportunities where
taking debt is completely justified, and in fact, the best course forward.

Software crafters take pride in delivering high quality code. This, however, should not mean that we are
unwilling to accept techincal debt. Suppose you're working for a large corporation and they have to comply
with new government regulations. The deadline is in two days and you know that you can get it done if you rush.
For every day that the company does not comply with new regulations, they get fined $1 million dollars.
Is it in everyone's best interest for you to just rush through the implementation, skip some tests,
skip the refactoring, and just get it out the door? Of course it is. Even if it takes a week to rewrite the code,
it will be cheaper than paying these fines. It's good debt.
